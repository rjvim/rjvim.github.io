Animations are a crucial part of modern web development, enhancing user experience and making interfaces more intuitive. In this guide, we'll explore fundamental animation concepts and implement them using two popular approaches:

1. **Tailwind CSS** - For quick, utility-first animations
2. **Framer Motion** - For more complex, declarative animations

By understanding both methods, you'll be equipped to choose the right tool for your animation needs, whether you need simple transitions or complex interactive animations.

import Opacity from "../../../components/animations/opacity.tsx";
import TranslateBox from "../../../components/animations/translate.tsx";
import Scale from "../../../components/animations/scale.tsx";
import RotateBox from "../../../components/animations/rotate.tsx";
import TransformOriginBox from "../../../components/animations/transform-origin.tsx";
import KeyframesBox from "../../../components/animations/keyframes.tsx";

## 1. Opacity

Opacity controls the transparency of an element, where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is fully opaque. This is a fundamental CSS property for creating fade effects.

#### With Tailwind

In Tailwind CSS, we can animate opacity using the `opacity` and `transition` utilities. The `transition` class specifies which property to animate, the duration, and the timing function. For example, we use `opacity-100` for full opacity, `hover:opacity-50` for the hover state, and `transition-opacity duration-700 ease-out` to control the transition.

#### With Framer Motion

Framer Motion provides a more declarative way to handle animations. The same effect can be achieved using:

- `initial`: Sets the starting state
- `animate`: Defines the animation
- `whileHover`: Handles hover states
- `transition`: Controls the animation timing

<CodeDisplay component={<Opacity />}>
  <include lang="tsx" meta={{ title: "opacity.tsx" }}>
    ../../../components/animations/opacity.tsx
  </include>
</CodeDisplay>

## 2. Translate

Translation moves an element from one position to another without affecting the document flow. It's commonly used for sliding and moving elements.

#### With Tailwind

For translation in Tailwind, we use the `translate-x-*` utilities. The `hover:translate-x-[50px]` class moves the element on hover, and `transition-transform duration-700 ease-out` ensures a smooth animation. The `transform` class enables the transform property.

#### With Framer Motion

Framer Motion simplifies this with the `x` property and provides more control over the animation states.

<CodeDisplay component={<TranslateBox />}>
  <include lang="tsx" meta={{ title: "translate.tsx" }}>
    ../../../components/animations/translate.tsx
  </include>
</CodeDisplay>

## 3. Scale

Scaling changes the size of an element. It's useful for creating zoom effects and visual feedback.

#### With Tailwind

In Tailwind, scaling is achieved using the `scale-*` utilities. The `hover:scale-150` class scales the element to 1.5x its size on hover, while `transition-transform duration-300 ease-out` controls the animation. The `transform` class is required to enable the transform property.

#### With Framer Motion

Framer Motion provides a more intuitive way to handle scaling with the `scale` property.

<CodeDisplay component={<Scale />}>
  <include lang="tsx" meta={{ title: "scale.tsx" }}>
    ../../../components/animations/scale.tsx
  </include>
</CodeDisplay>

## 4. Rotate

Rotation spins an element around its transform origin. It's great for creating spinning and turning effects.

#### With Tailwind

Rotation in Tailwind is done using the `rotate-*` utilities. The `hover:rotate-45` class rotates the element 45 degrees on hover. The `transition-transform duration-300 ease-out` class ensures a smooth rotation animation. The `transform` class is needed to enable the transform property.

#### With Framer Motion

Framer Motion simplifies rotation with the `rotate` property, which can be used in the animation states.

<CodeDisplay component={<RotateBox />}>
  <include lang="tsx" meta={{ title: "rotate.tsx" }}>
    ../../../components/animations/rotate.tsx
  </include>
</CodeDisplay>

## 5. Transform Origin

Transform origin changes the point around which transformations like rotate and scale are applied.

#### With Tailwind

Tailwind provides `origin-*` utilities to set the transform origin. The `origin-top-left` class sets the transform origin to the top-left corner. Combined with `hover:scale-150` and `transition-transform duration-300 ease-out`, this creates a scaling effect that originates from the top-left corner. The `transform` class is required to enable the transform property.

#### With Framer Motion

Framer Motion allows you to set the transform origin directly in the animation properties.

<CodeDisplay component={<TransformOriginBox />}>
  <include lang="tsx" meta={{ title: "transform-origin.tsx" }}>
    ../../../components/animations/transform-origin.tsx
  </include>
</CodeDisplay>

## 6. Keyframes

Keyframes allow for more complex animations by defining multiple steps in the animation sequence.

#### With Tailwind

For keyframe animations in Tailwind, you would typically define custom animations in your `tailwind.config.js` file. Since we haven't defined any custom keyframes in this project, we'll focus on the Framer Motion implementation which provides a more straightforward way to handle complex animations. However, in a typical Tailwind setup, you would define a custom animation in your config and then apply it using the `animate-*` utility class.

#### With Framer Motion

Framer Motion simplifies keyframe animations with the `animate` prop, allowing you to define an array of values.

<CodeDisplay component={<KeyframesBox />}>
  <include lang="tsx" meta={{ title: "keyframes.tsx" }}>
    ../../../components/animations/keyframes.tsx
  </include>
</CodeDisplay>
