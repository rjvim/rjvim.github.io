<VanillaMdx title="About" toc={toc}>

Hello! I am Rajiv, a software engineer and entrepreneur. You can find me on [X](https://x.com/rjv_im).

I have been running a web development agency, [betalectic.com](https://betalectic.com), since 2016. My work predominantly focuses on first-time founders who are self-funding or seed-funded and want to go to market with production-ready applications.

I love the challenge of working with limited resourcesâ€”it's a puzzle of assembling a tech stack that enables building scalable applications while keeping costs low until the product finds market fit. I consider myself a "full stack product and engineering tech guy" because the journey begins with product vision and is delivered through a sustainable tech stack.

I've built applications across diverse domains including EdTech, Real Estate, SaaS, WealthTech, Finance, and Banking, alongside fun projects and unique ideas.

The posts on this blog provide deeper insights into my work and experiences.

I share insights from failures, challenges, and successes through various perspectives.

Hire me to design and architect your product and engineering stack, or simply connect with me on [X](https://x.com/rjv_im) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajivseelam/).
